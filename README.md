# Treap Version 1.0.0

### An implementation of a treap data structure in Python 3

Treap data structure to store either strings or numbers (ints and floats).

A treap (tree+heap) is a randomized binary search tree. It combines the sorted order of a binary search tree and the min heap property 
of a heap. It attempts to keep the tree balanced with rotations according to random priority numbers (min heap).
